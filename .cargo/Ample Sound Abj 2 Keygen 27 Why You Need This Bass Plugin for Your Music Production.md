If you are looking for a bass guitar VST plugin that can deliver realistic and expressive performances, you might want to check out Ample Sound ABJ 2. This plugin is based on the samples of a Fender Jazz Bass (John English Masterbuilt), and it offers a rich and detailed sound with various articulations and playing techniques. In this review, we will take a closer look at the features and sound quality of Ample Sound ABJ 2, and see how it compares to other bass guitar plugins on the market.
 
## Features
 
Ample Sound ABJ 2 is a sample-based plugin that uses direct from disk (DFD) technology to reduce the memory usage and loading time. The plugin has a size of 3.71 GB, and it contains over 2700 samples with 24-bit depth and 44.1 kHz sample rate. The samples cover 12 articulations, including sustain, palm mute, natural harmonic, hammer on & pull off, legato slide, slide in & out, slap, pop, tap, accentuated, repeat note, and dead note.

This gives you more flexibility and control over the sound and performance of the plugin. You can also use the poly legato and slide smoother functions to create smooth transitions between notes and chords.
 
Another feature that makes Ample Sound ABJ 2 stand out is the alternate tuner that lets you tune each string individually, and even go as low as B0. You can also use the multiple capo logics to change the fingering logic automatically according to different scenarios, such as solo or chorus.
