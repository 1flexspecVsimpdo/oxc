The history of San Judas Tadeo dates back to the first century, when he was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. He was a relative of Jesus, possibly his cousin, and one of his first followers. After Christ's death and resurrection, he became an evangelizer and preached the gospel in Judea, Samaria, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Persia. He was martyred along with Simon the Zealot, by decapitation with a hatchet[^1^].
 
The devotion to San Judas Tadeo spread throughout the Christian world, especially in Europe and the Middle East. He was invoked as the patron saint of hopeless cases and desperate situations, because of a letter attributed to him in the New Testament, where he urges the faithful to persevere in their faith despite the difficulties and persecutions. He was also associated with miracles and healings.
 
The veneration of San Judas Tadeo reached Mexico with the Spanish colonization in the 16th century. He became one of the most popular saints among the Mexican people, especially among the poor and marginalized. His image was often carried by soldiers, workers, students, and activists. He was also adopted by some criminal groups as their protector.
