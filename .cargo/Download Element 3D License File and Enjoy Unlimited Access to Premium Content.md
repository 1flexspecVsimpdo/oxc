Element 3D is a powerful plugin for Adobe After Effects that allows you to create stunning 3D graphics and visual effects. However, to use Element 3D, you need to have a valid license file that you can download from the Video Copilot website. In this article, we will show you how to download and install Element 3D license file for After Effects in a few simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Download the Element 3D Installer
  
The first step is to download the Element 3D installer from the [Video Copilot website](https://www.videocopilot.net/products/element2/).

During the installation process, you will see a window where you can choose which versions of After Effects you want to install Element 3D to. You can also choose a custom location if you want to install the plugin to a different directory. Click next to continue.
  
## Step 3: License Element 3D

3. You can enter your Video Copilot Store login information and it will generate your license for you right there.

### Manual License Installation

1. Click on Request File, this will generate a License Request file.
2. Save your file to a location.
3. Go to your Video Copilot Store account download section and click on the Element download page.
4. Near the bottom right of the page, click browse under the Manual License Generator section to select the License Request File you saved.
5. Click Generate License and it will prompt you to save the License File.
6. Go back to After Effects and in the Element License window under step 3 click Install License File.
