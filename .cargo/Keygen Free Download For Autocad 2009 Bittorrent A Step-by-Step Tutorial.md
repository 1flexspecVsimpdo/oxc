If you want to download and install AutoCAD 2009 for free, you will need a keygen, which is a program that generates serial keys and activation codes for software. A keygen can help you bypass the registration and activation process of AutoCAD 2009 and use it without paying any fees. However, using a keygen is illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or compromise your personal data. Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen to download and install AutoCAD 2009 for free.
 
Instead, we suggest you use the official trial version of AutoCAD 2009, which is available for download from the Autodesk website. The trial version allows you to use AutoCAD 2009 for 30 days with full functionality and features. You can also access online tutorials, support, and community forums to learn more about AutoCAD 2009 and how to use it effectively. After the trial period expires, you can either purchase a license to continue using AutoCAD 2009 or uninstall it from your computer.
 
To download and install the trial version of AutoCAD 2009, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial) and click on "Download Free Trial".
