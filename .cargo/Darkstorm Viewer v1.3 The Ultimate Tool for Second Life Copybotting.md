If you are interested in 3D modeling and design, you should give Darkstorm Viewer v1.3 a try. You can download it for free from the developer's website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. You can also check out the official forum for more information and support.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use some of the features of Darkstorm Viewer v1.3 to create a simple 3D scene. You will need to download and install the software from the link provided above, and then launch it from your desktop.
 
When you open Darkstorm Viewer, you will see a blank window with a toolbar at the top and a status bar at the bottom. The toolbar contains icons for various functions, such as opening and saving files, creating and editing objects, changing the view mode and the camera angle, and accessing the settings and the help menu. The status bar shows information about the current scene, such as the number of objects, vertices and faces, the rendering mode and the frame rate.
 
To create a new scene, click on the File menu and select New. A dialog box will appear, asking you to choose a template for your scene. You can choose from several predefined templates, such as a cube, a sphere, a plane or a torus. For this example, we will choose the cube template and click OK.
 
A cube will appear in the center of the window, with a default gray texture. You can use your mouse to rotate, zoom and pan the view of the scene. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the camera around. To change the rendering mode of the scene, you can click on the View menu and select one of the options, such as Wireframe, Solid or Shaded.
 
To edit the cube, you can click on the Edit menu and select Mesh Editor. A new window will open, showing the mesh of the cube in detail. You can use your mouse to select and manipulate vertices, edges and faces of the mesh. You can also use the tools on the left panel to perform various actions, such as moving, scaling, rotating, extruding or deleting parts of the mesh. To apply changes to the scene, you need to click on the Apply button at the bottom of the window.

To apply a texture on the cube, you can click on the Edit menu and select Texture Browser. A new window will open, showing a list of textures that are available on your computer or on the web. You can browse through different categories and subcategories of textures, such as wood, metal, stone or fabric. You can also use the search box to find a specific texture by name or keyword. To apply a texture on the cube, you need to drag and drop it from the list to the cube in the main window.
 
To apply a texture on an object by using its UUID, you can click on the Edit menu and select UUID Tool. A new window will open, asking you to enter or paste a UUID in the text box. A UUID is a unique identifier that is assigned to every object in Second Life or other virtual worlds that use similar protocols. You can find UUIDs of objects by using online tools or by inspecting them in-world. To apply a texture on an object by using its UUID, you need to enter or paste it in the text box and click OK.
 
To print your scene or save it as an image file, you can click on the File menu and select Print or Save As Image. A dialog box will appear, asking you to choose a printer or a file name and format for your image. You can also adjust some settings such as paper size, orientation or resolution before printing or saving your image.
 
These are some of the basic features of Darkstorm Viewer v1.3 that you can use to create and modify 3D models and environments. There are many more features and options that you can explore by using this software. You can also visit the official forum for more tips and tutorials from other users.
