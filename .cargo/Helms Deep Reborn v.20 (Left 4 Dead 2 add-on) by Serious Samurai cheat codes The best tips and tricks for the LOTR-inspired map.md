# How to Unlock All Perks and Weapons in Helms Deep Reborn v.20 (Left 4 Dead 2 add-on) by Serious Samurai
 
Helms Deep Reborn is a popular custom map for Left 4 Dead 2 that recreates the epic battle from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The map was originally created by Team Chivalry for Half-Life 2: Age of Chivalry mod, and later ported and edited by SeriouS\_Samurai for Left 4 Dead 2. The map features a dynamic 3D skybox, custom models, textures, sounds, music and voiceclips from the movie, and a challenging survival mode where you have to defend the fortress from endless hordes of zombies.

However, some players may find the map too difficult or want to have more fun with it. That's why there are some cheat codes that can unlock all perks and weapons in the map. These cheat codes are not official and may not work on some servers or versions of the map, so use them at your own risk.
 
To use these cheat codes, you need to enable the developer console in Left 4 Dead 2. To do that, go to Options > Keyboard/Mouse > Enable Developer Console and set it to Yes. Then, press the tilde key (~) to open the console. You can also bind a key to toggle the console by typing `bind "key" "toggleconsole"` in the console, where "key" is any key you want.
 
Once you have the console open, you can type these cheat codes to unlock different perks and weapons in Helms Deep Reborn v.20:
 
- `!bill`, `!francis`, `!louis` and `!zoey`: These codes will spawn the Left 4 Dead 1 survivor bots to fight alongside you. You can only have one of each at a time.
- `!orcrist`: This code will give you a map-exclusive melee weapon called Orcrist, which is a sword that glows blue when zombies are near.
- `!bow`: This code will give you a bow and arrows that can shoot zombies from a distance. The bow has unlimited ammo but needs to be reloaded after every shot.
- `!shield`: This code will give you a shield that can block zombie attacks and knock them back. You can also bash zombies with it as a melee weapon.
- `!spear`: This code will give you a spear that can stab zombies and throw them off balance. You can also throw the spear at zombies as a ranged weapon.
- `!legolas`: This code will turn you into Legolas, the elf archer from The Lord of the Rings. You will have increased speed, agility and accuracy with the bow.
- `!gandalf`: This code will turn you into Gandalf, the wizard from The Lord of the Rings. You will have a staff that can shoot fireballs and lightning bolts at zombies.
- `!gimli`: This code will turn you into Gimli, the dwarf warrior from The Lord of the Rings. You will have an axe that can chop zombies in half and deal extra damage.
- `!horse`: This code will spawn a horse that you can ride around the map. The horse can run faster than zombies and trample them under its hooves.

These cheat codes can make Helms Deep Reborn v.20 more fun and easier to play, but they may also ruin the immersion and challenge of the map. Use them wisely and enjoy!
