The book contains more than 3,000 linguistic terms, complete with descriptions and examples, biographies of linguistic scholars, indexes of foreign terms, names of languages of the world, lists of symbols and signs, and important charts and diagrams in linguistics. The terms are taken from both international linguistics and the tradition of language research in Indonesia. Therefore, the book is both international and national in scope.
 
The book is useful for students, teachers, researchers, and anyone who is interested in linguistics or language studies. It covers various branches and subfields of linguistics, such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, historical-comparative linguistics, and more. It also explains some key concepts and theories in linguistics, such as generative grammar, case theory, diglossia, discourse analysis, speech acts, transformational rules, and many others.
 
The book is well-organized and easy to use. It has an alphabetical order of entries and cross-references for related terms. It also has a clear and consistent format for each entry, which includes the term in Indonesian and English, its definition or explanation, its examples or illustrations (if any), its synonyms or antonyms (if any), its origin or source (if known), and its references or citations (if any).

One of the strengths of the book is that it reflects the diversity and richness of the Indonesian language and its varieties. It includes terms that are specific to the Indonesian language or its dialects, such as dwiwasana (double meaning), silih (alternation), wicara (speech), and wacana (discourse). It also incorporates terms that are derived from other languages that have influenced Indonesian, such as Arabic, Sanskrit, Dutch, English, and Malay. It also recognizes the role and status of Indonesian as a national and official language in a multilingual and multicultural country.
 
Another strength of the book is that it updates and revises the previous editions to keep up with the latest developments and trends in linguistics. It adds new terms that have emerged or become popular in recent years, such as semantik generatif (generative semantics), sintagma (phrase), teori kasus (case theory), and diglosia (diglossia). It also modifies or deletes some terms that have become obsolete or outdated. It also corrects some errors or inconsistencies that were found in the previous editions.
 
However, the book also has some limitations and challenges. One of them is that it may not cover all the linguistic terms that exist or are used in different contexts and situations. Some terms may be too specialized or obscure to be included in the book. Some terms may also have different meanings or interpretations depending on the source or perspective. Therefore, the book may not be able to satisfy all the needs and expectations of its users.
 
Another limitation is that it may not be able to keep pace with the rapid and dynamic changes in linguistics and language studies. Linguistics is a constantly evolving and expanding field of knowledge that produces new terms and concepts every year. Language is also a living and changing system that undergoes various changes and innovations over time. Therefore, the book may need to be updated and revised more frequently to maintain its relevance and accuracy.
 
In spite of these limitations, Kamus Linguistik by Harimurti Kridalaksana remains a remarkable and useful work of reference for linguistics and language studies. It is a testament to the author's expertise and dedication to his field of study. It is also a contribution to the development and promotion of the Indonesian language and its studies.
