Os Tropeiros DVD 3 is part of a series that was directed by Pedro Farkas and produced by TV Cultura, a public television network in Brazil. The series was first aired in 1984 and received several awards and recognition for its artistic and historical value. The soundtrack of the series was composed by Marcus Viana, who used traditional instruments and songs from the regions depicted in the documentary.
 
The DVD 3 covers the period from 1760 to 1820, when the tropeiros of Minas Gerais and SÃ£o Paulo played a crucial role in the economic and social development of Brazil. They transported gold, coffee, sugar, salt, cheese, and other products across the country, connecting different regions and cultures. They also influenced the language, cuisine, folklore, and customs of the places they passed through.
 
The documentary shows the daily life of the tropeiros, their challenges and joys, their stories and legends, their beliefs and rituals. It also explores the historical context of their activity, such as the colonial administration, the taxation system, the independence movement, and the conflicts with indigenous people and bandits. The documentary features interviews with historians, researchers, descendants of tropeiros, and people who still practice this activity today.
  
Os Tropeiros DVD 3 also shows the gastronomic legacy of the tropeiros, who created dishes that are still popular today in many parts of Brazil. Some examples are feijÃ£o tropeiro (tropeiro beans), a dish made with beans, bacon, sausage, eggs, and cassava flour; paÃ§oca de carne seca (dried meat paÃ§oca), a mixture of shredded dried meat and cassava flour; and arroz carreteiro (cart rice), a rice dish cooked with dried meat and spices[^1^]. These dishes were practical and nutritious for the long journeys of the tropeiros, who also helped to spread the consumption of cheese, coffee, and cachaÃ§a (sugarcane liquor) across the country.
 
Another aspect highlighted by Os Tropeiros DVD 3 is the cultural and artistic expression of the tropeiros, who developed their own forms of music, dance, poetry, and handicrafts. Some examples are the cateretÃª (a dance that mixes indigenous and African influences), the cururu (a musical genre that involves improvisation and competition), the viola caipira (a type of acoustic guitar), the literatura de cordel (a type of popular poetry printed on leaflets), and the arte santeira (a type of religious sculpture made of wood or clay).
