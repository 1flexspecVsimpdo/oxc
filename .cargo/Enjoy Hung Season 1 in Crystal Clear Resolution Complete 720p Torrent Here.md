## Common Issues and Solutions for EasyWorship 2009 Build 14 on Windows 10
 
As mentioned earlier, EasyWorship 2009 is an old version that is not fully compatible with Windows 10. You may encounter some issues while using it, such as:

- The program crashes or freezes randomly.
- The program does not display correctly on high-resolution screens.
- The program does not play videos or audio files properly.
- The program does not recognize your license information.
- The program does not work with your projector or external monitor.

Some of these issues can be solved by applying the patch for Windows 10[^1^], updating your drivers, changing your compatibility settings, or reinstalling the program. However, some of these issues may not have a fix at all, since EasyWorship 2009 is no longer supported by the developer. Therefore, we recommend that you upgrade to a newer version of EasyWorship[^4^], such as EasyWorship 7, which is fully compatible with Windows 10 and has more features and improvements.
