# How to Install WoT Mods Fitgirl Repack
 
World of Tanks (WoT) is a popular online multiplayer game that features realistic tank battles. If you want to enhance your gaming experience, you can install various mods that add new features, graphics, sounds, and more. However, installing mods can be tricky, especially if you are using a repacked version of the game, such as the one by Fitgirl.
 
Fitgirl repacks are compressed versions of games that reduce the download size and installation time. They are also cracked, meaning they do not require any activation or online verification. However, they may not be compatible with some mods or updates, and they may have some issues with antivirus software or Windows Defender.
