EstiNet Network Simulator can integrate real-world high-quality core network software from the well-known free5GC group of National Chiao Tung University. It can also provide RAN and UE modules to build a complete 5G network. It can run on cloud systems and support flexible construction of virtual and real networks. It can also load new Docker images to create new network nodes and simulate new network technologies.
 
EstiNet Network Simulator is the best development and research platform for 5G networks. It can effectively reproduce specific network behaviors and evaluate the performance of 5G applications and protocols. It can also help researchers and developers to test their new ideas and innovations on a realistic 5G network environment.

Another benefit of 5G technology is that it can support a much higher capacity on the network. This means that more devices can be connected and communicate with each other without affecting the network performance. This is especially important for the Internet of Things (IoT), which involves billions of smart devices that collect and exchange data over the internet.
 
5G can enable new applications and services that leverage the power of IoT, such as smart cities, smart homes, smart agriculture, smart health care, and smart transportation. For example, 5G can help improve traffic management by allowing vehicles to communicate with each other and with traffic signals, reducing congestion and accidents. 5G can also help monitor and control environmental conditions, such as air quality, water quality, and energy consumption.
 
One of the most exciting features of 5G is that it can offer much lower latency than 4G. Latency is the time it takes for a signal to travel from its source to its destination and back again. Lower latency means faster response time and less delay in data transmission. This can enable new applications that require real-time interaction, such as cloud gaming, virtual reality, augmented reality, telemedicine, and remote surgery.
 
For example, 5G can allow gamers to play high-quality games on their mobile devices without lag or buffering. 5G can also allow users to experience immersive VR and AR content on their smartphones or headsets without wires or cables. 5G can also allow doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely using high-definition video and haptic feedback.
