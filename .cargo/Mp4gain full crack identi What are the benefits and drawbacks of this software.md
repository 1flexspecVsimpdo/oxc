## How to Use Mp4Gain
 
Using Mp4Gain is a fairly simple process and can normalize your files in batches. First, you need to download and install the software from the official website. Then, you can launch the software and click on Add File(s) or Add Folder and browse to the files you want to normalize. Or you can simply drag and drop the files you want into the app. You can add audio or video files of different formats and Mp4Gain will recognize them automatically.
 
Next, you need to decide the Target Volume level for your files. This is the level that Mp4Gain will use to normalize your files. You can use the default value of 89 dB, which is recommended by the Replay Gain standard, or you can adjust it according to your preference. You can also choose whether to apply Track Gain or Album Gain to your files. Track Gain will normalize each file individually, while Album Gain will normalize all the files as a whole, preserving their relative volume differences.
 
After setting the Target Volume level, you can click on Normalize to start the normalization process. Mp4Gain will analyze and adjust the volume of your files without re-encoding them, which means that it will not affect their quality or duration. You can see the progress and status of each file on the main window. When the normalization process is finished, you can play your files and enjoy their improved sound quality.
